## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my blog project for development purposes. It uses localStorage for database. While creating it, I used NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS, JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. You can view recent blogs on main page. You can create, update or delete posts on other tabs. It automatically updates main page.

Just give it a minute. It renders slow at first because of the provider (Not because of me).
